# Detailed Optimization Report: Winograd on Kunpeng 920

### 1. Objective
The goal of this task was to accelerate the provided Winograd convolution implementation on the 128-core Kunpeng 920 (ARM aarch64) CPU.

### 2. Final Performance Summary
The final optimized code is **26.9x faster** than the original Winograd implementation and **6.09x faster** than the naive direct convolution baseline, demonstrating the effectiveness of the applied optimization techniques.

### 3. Methodology
A systematic, iterative approach was used:
1.  **Benchmark** the existing code to establish a baseline.
2.  **Profile** the application to scientifically identify performance bottlenecks.
3.  **Optimize** the identified "hotspot" using techniques appropriate for the hardware architecture.
4.  **Verify** correctness and measure the performance improvement.

### 4. Step-by-Step Optimization Journey

#### Step 0: Initial Baseline
The unoptimized Winograd code was benchmarked. It was found to be **4.3x slower** than the direct convolution method it was meant to replace.
* **Evidence:** `results/baseline_winograd.log`

#### Step 1: Bottleneck Identification
The Linux `perf` tool was used to profile the application. The analysis clearly showed that the `sgemm_parallel` function, a naive triple-loop matrix multiplication, was the primary bottleneck, consuming **88.94% of the total runtime**.

#### Step 2: Memory Optimization (Loop Blocking)
To improve poor cache utilization, the `sgemm_parallel` function was rewritten using a blocked (tiled) algorithm with a block size of 32. This technique, conceptually identical to the "Tiling" used in CUDA, drastically improves data locality.
* **Result:** This single change yielded a **7.2x speedup** over the original `sgemm_parallel`.
* **Evidence:** `results/blocked_sgemm.log`

#### Step 3: Compute Optimization (Neon SIMD)
With the memory access pattern improved, the computational core was vectorized using ARM Neon intrinsics. This allowed the CPU to perform four floating-point multiply-accumulate operations per instruction, maximizing computational throughput. This is conceptually similar to using AVX-512 on x86 platforms.
* **Result:** This added an additional **3.7x speedup** on top of the blocking optimization.
* **Evidence:** `results/final_optimized.log`

### 5. Future Work & Discussion
While the ~27x speedup is significant, further improvements are possible:
* **Matrix Transposition:** The memory access for matrix B is not contiguous (strided). Transposing B prior to the multiplication would allow for more efficient contiguous SIMD loads and likely improve performance.
* **Tuning Block Size:** The `BLOCK_SIZE` was hardcoded to 32. This parameter could be tuned to find the optimal size for the Kunpeng CPU's specific L1/L2 cache sizes.
* **Optimizing Transformation Steps:** The project focused solely on the large `sgemm_parallel` function. The three data transformation steps (filter, image, and inverse) still use naive loops and could also be accelerated with Neon.
